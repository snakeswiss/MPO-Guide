# FAQ – MPO / MPO+

---

### ❓ How can I host a game?

You need to **port forward your UDP port** (default is `5730`) to the IP address of your computer (if using **PPSSPP**) or your **PSP® / PS Vita®**.

---

### ❓ Is my account ID compatible with both MPO and MPO+?

Yes, your **account ID works for both games** and across all regions.

---

### ❓ If I'm playing a specific region version of the game (e.g., US/NA), can I play against EU or JAP players?

**No.** You must play the **same region version** of the game. There are compatibility issues that **prevent cross-region play**.

---

### ❓ How can I see my ranking on the Leaderboards or Stats page?

**Rankings are updated daily at : 10am (CET / UTC+1) | 5pm (JST / UTC+9) | 4am (EST / UTC−4)**, not in real time.

---

### ❓ When do the weekly stats reset?

Weekly stats and leaderboards **reset every Tuesday at : 10am (CET / UTC+1) | 5pm (JST / UTC+9) | 4am (EST / UTC−4)**.

---

### ❓ I lost my soldiers in RC (Ranked) matches. Can I recover them?

**No.** Your soldiers were **captured by other players**.

To avoid this:

- Use the **System Fulton** when your soldier dies (Select + L buttons in same time).
- If Fulton cannot be used (e.g., there’s a roof above you when you die), press the **Start** button and select **White Flag** to recover your Soldier(s) **before** the end of the game.
  
The **White Flag** costs **10 score points**, but **all your dead soldiers will be backed up and saved** from the current game.

### ❓ What’s the difference between VR and RC modes?

- **VR Mode**: Casual matches – *no risk of soldier loss and not ranked, you cannot have a rank/Elite animal titles playing on VR*.
- **RC Mode**: Ranked matches – *soldiers can be captured and ranked matches, you have a Rank/Elite animal titles playing on RC*.

### ❓ Why can’t I join a specific game host?

You might be on the **host’s blacklist**, which prevents you from joining their games, please, respect the choice of other players.
