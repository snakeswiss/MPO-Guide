### ❓ I lost my soldiers in RC (Ranked) matches. Can I recover them?

**No.** Your soldiers were **captured by other players**.

To avoid this while playing on RC matches:

- Use the **Fulton System** when your soldier dies **before** he is lying on the ground (**Select** + **L** buttons in same time).
- If the Fulton System cannot be used (e.g., There was a roof above you when you died, or you were killed while lying on the ground, or by auto-aim.), press the **Start** button and select **White Flag** to recover your Soldier(s) **before** the end of the current game.
  
The **Fulton System** cost **1 score point**

The **White Flag** costs **10 score points**, but **all your dead soldiers will be backed up and saved** from the current game.

### ❓ What’s the difference between VR and RC modes?

- **VR Mode**: Casual matches – *no risk of soldier loss and not ranked games, you cannot get a rank/Elite animal titles playing on VR mode*.
- **RC Mode**: Ranked matches – *soldiers can be captured and ranked games, you can get a Rank/Elite animal titles if you play well on RC mode*.
