# FAQ – MPO / MPO+ Infrastructure (+)

### ❓ How can I host a game?

You'll need to **port forward your UDP port** (by default in MPO/MPO+ it's the UDP port: `5730`) to the IP address of your computer (if using **PPSSPP**) or your **PSP / PS Vita**.

---

### ❓ Is my account ID compatible with both MPO and MPO+?

Yes, your **account ID works for both games** and across all regions.

---

### ❓ If I'm playing a specific region version of the game (e.g., US/NA), can I play against EU or JAP players (cross-region)?

**No.** You must play the **same region version** of the game. There are compatibility issues that **prevent cross-region play**.

**Rankings are updated once per day at:**  
🕙 **10:00 AM (CET / UTC+1)** | **5:00 PM (JST / UTC+9)** | **4:00 AM (EST / UTC−4)**

### ❓ I lost my soldiers in RC (Ranked) matches. Can I recover them?

**No.** Your soldiers were **captured by other players**.

To avoid this while playing on RC matches:

- Use the **Fulton System** when your soldier dies before he is lying on the ground (**Select** + **L** buttons in same time).
- If the Fulton System cannot be used (e.g., there’s a roof above you when you die), press the **Start** button and select **White Flag** to recover your Soldier(s) **before** the end of the current game.
  
The **White Flag** costs **10 score points**, but **all your dead soldiers will be backed up and saved** from the current game.

### ❓ What’s the difference between VR and RC modes?

- **VR Mode**: Casual matches – *no risk of soldier loss and not ranked games, you cannot get a rank/Elite animal titles playing on VR mode*.
- **RC Mode**: Ranked matches – *soldiers can be captured and ranked games, you can get a Rank/Elite animal titles if you play well on RC mode*.
