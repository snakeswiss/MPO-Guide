# PSP Setup (Real Hardware) ![PSP Logo](../assets/Psp-logo.png)

## Requirements
- A PSP with custom firmware (e.g. PRO-C2, ME, or Infinity)
- A memory stick with at least 1 GB free
- A legally dumped copy of MPO / MPO+ in ISO or CSO format or original UMD

---

## Installation Steps
1. Connect your PSP to your computer via USB mode.
2. On the memory stick, create a folder named `ISO` (if it doesn't exist).
3. Copy your `MPO.iso` or `MPO+.iso` file into the `ISO` folder.
4. Disconnect the PSP safely.
5. On the XMB (main PSP menu), go to **Game > Memory Stick** and launch the game.

## Recommended Settings
To improve compatibility and loading times:

1. Reboot PSP into **Recovery Menu**:
   - Hold `R` while powering on the console.
2. Go to:
   - `Configuration > UMD Mode`
   - Set to `Sony NP9660 - NO UMD`
3. Disable plugins you donâ€™t need (optional).

## Multiplayer (Adhoc) Tips
- MPO+ multiplayer still works via **Adhoc Party (PS3)** or **PPSSPP Adhoc Server**.
- For native PSP-PSP local multiplayer:
  - Use the same game version (region matters!)
  - Disable power saving settings during matches.
